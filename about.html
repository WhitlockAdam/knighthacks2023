      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        &emsp;We created this program because we found that it is surprisingly
        difficult to find water refill stations around campus. Many people find
        themselves walking to the only spot they know, just to get their water
        bottle refilled, when they may have already passed a close-by refill
        station.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;By making the refill stations more known and accessible, it makes
        refilling your water bottle a convenience, rather than an inconvenience.
        It encourages people to refill their water bottles, which and reduces
        the use of plastic waste. We are hoping to help students become more
        environmentally freindly.
